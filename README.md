# MERN Fullstack Website

Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) fullstack website! This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and includes features such as a login page, signup page, and a contact form. The passwords are encrypted using bcrypt for enhanced security. All contact form data is stored in the database.

- **Models**: Contains MongoDB models for the data schema.
- **Views**: Frontend components and pages built using React.js.
- **Controllers**: Backend logic implemented using Express.js.
- **Routes**: Express.js routes handling different API endpoints.
- **Config**: Configuration files, including database connection setup.
- **Public**: Static assets and public files.
- **Server**: Main server setup and entry point.
